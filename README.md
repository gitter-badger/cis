## The idea behind the scene
est:
The task is difficult in the way that we are dealing with users who have never used or used little the computer. They are smart people, thing is that the countrys internet support is not very good, so computerskill is not a usual thing. At the same time they usually have smartphones, so they are used to the mobile interface.

The workflow is completed on the paper at the moment. Large files, bare minimum at the same time: they use to add stamps and signatures on the same paper what indicates the specific flow then.

The idea is to keep it as close to the paperflow as possible - to keep the learning curve minimal. RIKs analysts insisted to keep workong on the table format. I oppose it: in my opinion there are thing you can not convert directly from paper to computer without losing in performance. Inserting data into a table is one of them.

Instead I intend to use inputs as questionary. The inputs will look like fields on paper - bare underline. Very important is the organic animation of things, that form elements would respond to user and guide them through process. The process should feel like working on paper but have more guidance.

Luckily,  ideas are in the air, Google is building his Material design what almost completely refers to my ideas toward particular design task.

## Fonts
We go with the bulletproofed [Google fonts](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/typography.html#): Roboto (light, Normal, Medium e.g. 300, 400, 500) for english version, Noto for arabic and kurdish. Thats for the webpage. All the documents influenced by MS Word and possibly sent by email shall use unicode fonts.
